# This YAML file describes the supported platforms in Microkit.
# It mainly exists so that the seL4 documentation website can list
# the supported platforms in a data-oriented way.
#
# For each new platform, please at least supply the following:
# name: the Microkit name in build_sdk.py
# cmake_plat: the name of the platform in the seL4 kernel build-system
# since: if this is a new platform, put 'dev' otherwise put what the
#        first released Microkit version the platform was available in.
#
# This list is ordered based on the order in what the platforms were added
# in.
