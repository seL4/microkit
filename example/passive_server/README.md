# Example - Passive Server

This example shows a client and server PD communicating with each
other where the server does not have an active scheduling context
and is therefore a 'passive' server.

When the client PPCs into the server, the server is executing on
the client's budget. See the manual for more details on passive
PDs.

All supported platforms are supported in this example.
