# Example - Hierarchy

This example shows off the parent/child PD concept in Microkit as
well as fault handling. The parent 'restarter' PD receives faults
from the 'crasher' PD that is intentionally crashing and then
resets the crasher's program counter.

All supported platforms are supported in this example.

## Building

```sh
mkdir build
make BUILD_DIR=build MICROKIT_BOARD=<board> MICROKIT_CONFIG=<debug/release/benchmark> MICROKIT_SDK=/path/to/sdk
